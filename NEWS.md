# graticule 0.1.5.9005

* Fix bug caused by new tile creation. https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/SOmap/issues/66

* Tile and line graticules are now created by the same process, which discretizes
to a default value of 5e4m (50km). This is settable with `options(graticule.mindist = )`. 

* graticule no longer shares the extra dependency from raster on rgeos, rasterToPolygons is no longer used

* Added supporting information to the package.
